# quarto-dissertation

This is a Quarto extension that renders a PDF of a dissertation/thesis that roughly follows the [Vanderbilt University Dissertation template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/vanderbilt-university-dissertation-template/fmqpcfjqtgyq). I created it by building upon the work of [Dr. Alberto Guzman's template for Pitt](https://github.com/alberto-guzman/quarto-dissertation). 

The extension primarily works using Quarto and a series of LaTeX partials found in the `tex` folder. To use, you will need to modify within the tex folder:

- `_acknowledgements.tex`: add your acknowledgements. If you don't want this page, comment out the line `$_acknowledgements.tex()$` from `before-body.tex`. 
- `_copyright.tex`: adjust the year. If you don't want this page, comment out the line `$_copyright.tex()$` from `before-body.tex`. 
- `_dedication.tex`: add your dedication. If you don't want this page, comment out the line `$_copyright.tex()$` from `before-body.tex`. 
- `_title.tex`: only change your major and committee member names

The template was created to be used for a 3-paper dissertation/thesis, although it can be easily modified to accommodate a traditional dissertation â€“ just swap the .qmd files with your dissertation chapters.

Some things may not be quite up to standards; please make sure you review the [Vanderbilt graduate school guidliens for formatting dissertations](https://gradschool.vanderbilt.edu/academics/theses/Format_Guidelines_08_2021.pdf).

(I'm not sure if the below will work, will test at some point).

## Installing the extension

To use this extension, navigate to your desired directory and type the following command in your terminal:

```{bash}
quarto use template fcmeyer/vu-quarto-dissertation
```

## Using template on an existing directory/folder

If you already have an existing Quarto project or document, you may add the template by typing the following in your terminal:

```{bash}
quarto add fcmeyer/vu-quarto-dissertation
```

### Contributing to the template

From the original author:

> Writing my dissertation in Quarto was both exciting and challenging, given that Quarto had just been released. However, I believe Quarto is an amazing tool for creating reproducible dissertations. I plan on gradually creating documentation for this template, but I also welcome the help of contributors! Happy Writing!
